# Deploying the Neighborly App with Azure Functions

## Project Overview

For the final project of the updated Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree, an app called "Neighborly" was built and deployed. Neighborly is a Python Flask-powered web application that allows neighbors to post advertisements for services and products they can offer.

The Neighborly project is comprised of a front-end application that is built with the Python Flask micro framework. The application allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete the community advertisements.

The application makes direct requests to the back-end API endpoints. These are endpoints that we will also build for the server-side of the application.

You can see an example of the deployed app below.

## Preface
I completed the FullStack Nanodegree a while ago. I recently was fortunate enough to take the winter testing out various development environments with all three major desktop operating systems Windows, Ubuntu, and MacOS. My original configuration during the previous Nanodegree was using my MBPro and at the time Udacity was giving us servers to work off of running Ubuntu. I've ended up right back to that configuration with my own server. It's the best of both worlds and no one has to DevOps your solution from arm64 back to x86. Although incredibly effective, you also don't need to download iTerm and emulate it for x86 to reinstall all your packages again in x86 in order to get Azure Functions running locally on your arm64. I digress. 

## Ubuntu Environment
To keep this as simple as possible, I would HIGHLY advise building this on Ubuntu. If you need to ssh into a VM or server remember the ssh tunnel so you can check you local build. Azure will default to localhost:7071, making your login:
```bash
ssh -L [portForClient]:localhost:[portFromServer] [user]@[ip address] -p [ssh port]
```

In my case that would be:
```bash
ssh -L 3000:localhost:7071 jasen@XXX.XXX.X.XXX -p XX
```


## Getting Started
On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you can do this with:

```bash
# install pipenv
sudo apt install pipenv

# install azure-cli
sudo apt install azure-cli

# install azure function core tools 
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-$(lsb_release -cs)-prod $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install azure-functions-core-tools-4
        
# get the mongodb library
sudo apt install mongo-tools

# check if mongoimport lib exists
mongoimport --version
```

## Resources
Ensure terminal is running in the project folder
```bash
bash resource.rh
```
the output should look like resourcesOutput.json

Copy the connection string to local.settings.json if not already there. 

## Confirm import of Sample Data Into MongoDB.
- Rources should import the data from the `sample_data` directory for Ads and Posts to initially fill your app.

        # finally import data from json files to the MongoDB API Collections
        mongoimport --uri $connectionString --d $databaseName --collection $adsCollection --file="./sample_data/sampleAds.json" --jsonArray
        mongoimport --uri $connectionString --d $databaseName --collection $postsCollection --file="./sample_data/samplePosts.json" --jsonArray

- Example successful import:
        
        Importing ads data ------------------->
        2020-05-18T23:30:39.018-0400  connected to: mongodb://neighborlyapp.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/
        2020-05-18T23:30:40.344-0400  5 document(s) imported successfully. 0 document(s) failed to import.
        ...
        Importing posts data ------------------->
        2020-05-18T23:30:40.933-0400  connected to: mongodb://neighborlyapp.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/
        2020-05-18T23:30:42.260-0400  4 document(s) imported successfully. 0 document(s) failed to import.
        
## Confirm connection strings

8. Hook up your connection string into the NeighborlyAPI server folder. You will need to replace the *url* variable with your own connection string you copy-and-pasted in the last step, along with some additional information.
    - Tip: Check out [this post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/connect-mongodb-account) if you need help with what information is needed.
    - Go to each of the `__init__.py` files in getPosts, getPost, getAdvertisements, getAdvertisement, deleteAdvertisement, updateAdvertisement, createAdvertisements and replace your connection string. You will also need to set the related `database` and `collection` appropriately.

    ```bash
    # inside getAdvertisements/__init__.py

    def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
        logging.info('Python getAdvertisements trigger function processed a request.')

        try:
            # copy/paste your primary connection url here
            #-------------------------------------------
            url = ""
            #--------------------------------------------

            client=pymongo.MongoClient(url)

            database = None # Feed the correct key for the database name to the client
            collection = None # Feed the correct key for the collection name to the database

            ... [other code omitted]
            
    ```

    Make sure to do the same step for the other 6 HTTP Trigger functions.

9. Deploy your Azure Functions.

    1. Test it out locally first.

        ```bash
        # cd into NeighborlyAPI
        cd NeighborlyAPI

        # install dependencies
        pipenv install

        # go into the shell
        pipenv shell

        # test func locally
        func start --build [-p 7071] --verbose
        ```

        You may need to change `"IsEncrypted"` to `false` in `local.settings.json` if this fails.

        At this point, Azure functions are hosted in localhost:7071.  You can use the browser or Postman to see if the GET request works.  For example, go to the browser and type in: 

        ```bash
        # example endpoint for all advertisements
        http://localhost:7071/api/getadvertisements

        #example endpoint for all posts
        http://localhost:7071/api/getposts
        ```

    2. Now you can deploy functions to Azure by publishing your function app.

        The result may give you a live url in this format, or you can check in Azure portal for these as well:

        Expected output if deployed successfully:
        ```bash
        Functions in <APP_NAME>:
            createAdvertisement - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/createadvertisement

            deleteAdvertisement - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/deleteadvertisement

            getAdvertisement - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/getadvertisement

            getAdvertisements - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/getadvertisements

            getPost - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/getpost

            getPosts - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/getposts

            updateAdvertisement - [httpTrigger]
                Invoke url: https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/updateadvertisement

        ```

        **Note:** It may take a minute or two for the endpoints to get up and running if you visit the URLs.

        Save the function app url **https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/** since you will need to update that in the client-side of the application.

### II. Deploying the client-side Flask web application

We are going to update the Client-side `settings.py` with published API endpoints. First navigate to the `settings.py` file in the NeighborlyFrontEnd/ directory.

Use a text editor to update the API_URL to your published url from the last step.
```bash
# Inside file settings.py

# ------- For Local Testing -------
#API_URL = "http://localhost:7071/api"

# ------- For production -------
# where APP_NAME is your Azure Function App name 
API_URL="https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api"
```

### III. CI/CD Deployment

1. Deploy your client app. **Note:** Use a **different** app name here to deploy the front-end, or else you will erase your API. From within the `NeighborlyFrontEnd` directory:
    - Install dependencies with `pipenv install`
    - Go into the pip env shell with `pipenv shell`
    - Deploy your application to the app service. **Note:** It may take a minute or two for the front-end to get up and running if you visit the related URL.

    Make sure to also provide any necessary information in `settings.py` to move from localhost to your deployment.

2. Create an Azure Registry and dockerize your Azure Functions. Then, push the container to the Azure Container Registry.
3. Create a Kubernetes cluster, and verify your connection to it with `kubectl get nodes`.
4. Deploy app to Kubernetes, and check your deployment with `kubectl config get-contexts`.

### IV. Event Hubs and Logic App

1. Create a Logic App that watches for an HTTP trigger. When the HTTP request is triggered, send yourself an email notification.
2. Create a namespace for event hub in the portal. You should be able to obtain the namespace URL.
3. Add the connection string of the event hub to the Azure Function.

### V.  Cleaning Up Your Services

Before completing this step, make sure to have taken all necessary screenshots for the project! Check the rubric in the classroom to confirm.

Clean up and remove all services, or else you will incur charges.

```bash
# replace with your resource group
RESOURCE_GROUP="<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>"
# run this command
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
